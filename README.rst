The ``eigenstrapping`` toolbox is designed to help researchers generate
statistically-rigorous models for null hypothesis testing between brain maps using
non-local spectral shape descriptors - or geometric eigenmodes.
Documentation can be found `here <https://eigenstrapping.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.

Features
--------

- A growing library of eigenmodes of standard surfaces and surface densities (fsaverage, fsLR)
- Cortical and subcortical null models for assessing statistical correspondence between brain maps
- Generation of geometric eigenmodes on user-derived surfaces
