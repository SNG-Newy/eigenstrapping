.. _tutorial_subcortex:Tutorial 2: Generating surrogate subcortical maps=================================================While the majority of spatial nulls work best with cortical data in surface space,``eigenstrapping`` can also generate nulls based on subcortical data in volumetricspace. If you have these two things:* A subcortical map, i.e., a volume or delimited `*.txt` file* A mask image, i.e., a label volumethen generating subcortical nulls is simple.You would call the function in a similar manner as the cortical fit:.. code-block:: py    >>> from eigenstrapping import fit, datasets    >>> thalamus_data, thalamus_mask = datasets.load_subcort(version='thalamus')    >>> type(thalamus_data)    nib.Nifti1Image        >>> type(thalamus_mask)    nib.Nifti1Image        >>> thal_surrs = fit.volumetric_fit(                        x=thalamus_data,                        mask=thalamus_mask,                        nsurrs=100,                        num_modes=500,                        resample=True,                        return_data=True                        )The above function uses some external libraries (``gmsh`` and FreeSurfer ``mri_mc``)to generate the subcortical meshes based on the `volume`. The above code willoutput a few figures as with the `eigenstrapping.fit.surface_fit` function:.. image:: ../_static/examples/example_figs/tutorial_subcortex1.png   :scale: 70%   :align: center    In the above example, we loaded subcortical data where the data is a volume inMNI152 2mm space (based on cortico-subcortical gradients generated using theconnectopic mapping approach, see :ref:`References <references>`), and the mask image is a label volume in MNI152 space where the ROI is labelled as "1" and thenon-ROI (the rest of the volume) is labelled "0". Nulls with labels or multiple labels (label fusion)---------------------------------------------------Functions of ``eigenstrapping`` also accept non-mask ROIs, such as parcellated (labelled) images with a single label or list of labels. *Tutorial forthcoming*
